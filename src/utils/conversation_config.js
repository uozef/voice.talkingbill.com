Further to our brief discussion this afternoon, I hope the follows detailed email will serve as a preamble to our discussion with your friend in the UAE.

On this note please have a careful read of the below as I believe this is a great opportunity for all concerned, in particular, the investor who may have an appetite in finding a Unicorn in this vast Fintech arena!

As I mentioned, this is a highly promising investment opportunity in a revolutionary financial product— the Equity Preservation Mortgage®️ (EPM).
This product is designed to fill a significant gap in the market for the 65% of homeowner retirees who are cash poor and for whom there is no product other than a reverse mortgage, both in the U.S., UK and Australia, offering stable tax-free annuity income without depleting home equity nor sharing of property appreciation.

I believe EPM represents an excellent opportunity, particularly in the Australian retiree market where it is to be first launched in Q2 2025, where this product is poised to make a transformative impact.

Market Overview and Potential

The Australian retiree market comprises approximately 4.2 million older Australians (aged 65+), with a projected increase to between 21% and 23% of the total population by 2066.

More than 75% of retirees own their homes outright, with the average net wealth being A$1.38 million. This translates to a significant potential customer base for the EPM, as many retirees are asset-rich but cash-poor.   This cohort is never going to buy traditional retirement funding products such as an annuity, guaranteed fixed income product, buffered ETF or other investment product given their inability to fund up-front cash premiums.

While “Reverse Mortgages" are available, they have been met with resistance due to home equity erosion and high compounding interest rates. The Australian market is dominated by non-bank lenders like Heartland whose reverse mortgage book now exceed $4Bn. The UK equity release market is dominated by life insurers and the US mortgage market by a mix of banks, insurance carriers and over twenty-thousand non-bank lenders.

The EPM product differentiates itself by preserving home equity while providing tax-free annuity income, effectively addressing retirees' concerns and offering a new product solution to the A$20 billion reverse mortgage market, that delivers far better financial outcomes.

Key Features of EPM 

Preservation of Home Equity - Unlike traditional reverse mortgages, EPM allows retirees to unlock equity in their homes while ensuring the full value of the home is preserved for heirs. 
Tax-Free Annuity Income - Borrowers receive tax-free annuity payments over a fixed term, a much-needed cash flow for retirees. 
S&P 500 Index-Linked Returns – A key innovation in the EPM is that it is a mortgage referenced to S&P 500 index to pay loan interest quarterly and thereby removing the compounding interest cost (the inherent defect in reverse mortgages), whilst mitigating risks through capital markets (buffered ETFs, dynamic hedging, S&P put options) and insurance markets (mortgage insurance, residual risk reinsurance) via global partners and counterparties such as Blackrock, Apollo, Goldman Sachs, Milliman and Spiderock, Lockton Insurance and MunichRe. 
No age or LVR restrictions - The product is age-independent and allows up to 80% Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) because loan interest is paid using a simple interest rate structure and not accrued and compounded for up to 30+ years as occurs in a reverse mortgage. 
Risk Management — Another key to the EPM is its long time horizons from15-30 years.  Total returns on the S&P500 over the same durations are 9.75%.  This covers the EPM retail cost which is BBSW +3.5%. From a risk management perspective, the S&P has long history, predictable returns and known volatility.  It is also a risk managed pool in-and-of-itself that holds only the strongest capitalised US companies (as the S&P Committee removes non-performers from the 500).  This also, effectively, futureproof’s the index against the emergence of new companies, industries and technologies.  This makes an index-linked mortgage much lower risk for a lender than their customer’s ability to service the debt (as in a forward mortgage) or the value of their property in 30+ year’s time (in a reverse mortgage).  
Credit Risk – The Borrower never pays loan interest under any circumstances – it is paid from the mortgage itself on their behalf.  The Mortgage Memorandum of the EPM makes interest-payment risk, the Lender’s.  So, credit risk is not borrower serviceability, but simply index risk and counterparty risk - this has profound effects from a regulatory point of view, for RMBS securitizations and for the Borrower. 
The risk of index volatility is effectively mitigated using S&P 500-linked, passively-managed, equally-weighted ETFs that are ‘set-and-forget’ (to simply allow the long-time horizons to smooth returns and deal with downturns and market cycles, with hedging and insurance to ensure predictable and stable minimum returns and to remove residual credit risk for the Lender.  

Financial Projections

For just the retiree market, and using recent data on Australia's ageing population and retirees' asset values, the potential for this product is vast. 

Let's consider the following refinement over a 30-year projection:  

Retiree Population: Over the next 30 years, the number of retirees in Australia is expected to grow significantly, representing a continuously expanding market.
Market Penetration: We aim to capture 15% of the Australian equity release market within the first 5 years, scaling to 20% by year 10. This represents 320,000 retiree households at an average loan value of A$400,000.
Total Market Size: This amounts to an accessible market size of approximately A$128 billion in Australia alone.  
Investor Returns Based on $10M investment and 20% equity in the Company (two convertible notes of US$5Mn each are available in this final Pre-A round)

For an investor placing a nominal $10 million investment with 20% equity retained in the company, the following projections over 30 years offer a compelling outlook:  

Annual Cash Flow - The initial $10M investment is used to complete the current EPM platform development, grow partnerships and market launch in Australia and UK initially with 2 non-bank lenders. 
End 2025 – Series A of USD$100Mn for US market launch and globally scale the business (already in discussions with interest from Tier One VCs)
By Year 5 - Expected revenue from 15% market penetration = A$9.6 billion, with a 20% stake yielding A$1.92 billion.
By Year 10 - With 20% market share, estimated revenue climbs to A$25.6 billion, with returns for your 20% stake reaching A$5.12 billion.  
Compounded Returns: The Company is in global collaboration with Accenture, which has hundreds of banks and insurers as clients world-wide.   Futureproof is not a mortgage business – it provides the SaaS Product & Funding Platform through which the EPM is written by its Product Issuers (financial institutions).  
It is a B2B2C tech business with 15-30 year ARR (taken as 50bps loan margin from every mortgage written world-wide). Over 30 years, the compounding effect of new mortgages being written by banks, insurers and non-bank lenders, on top of continuing 15-30 year mortgages already written and growing market share of product issuers, will quickly grow EPM mortgage books and could lead to multibillion-dollar returns. 

Risk Mitigation - The credit risk is removed through several layers of risk management: 
Mortgage referenced to S&P Index fundamentally changes the nature of underlying credit risk associated with the mortgage
Long-time horizons smoothen 3-5 year cycles to deliver predictable returns with known volatility over 30 years
Mortgage Insurance fully insures each mortgage
Hedging of Index risks are transferred to global capital market counterparties using buffered ETFs and S&P put options
Reinsurance of residual risk are transferred to global insurance counter-parties  
Key Risk Mitigation Strategies

Understanding the risks involved is crucial to any investment decision, particularly when considering a new product in a relatively conservative market. 

Here’s how EPM addresses potential concerns:  

Economic Volatility - The EPM has been back-tested using stochastic modelling and real interest-rate and S&P data over the last 30 years. Even during that worst of all periods, the EPM performed, all interest was covered and a $1.5Mn surplus generated by end-of loan term (which is shared by Futureproof and its capital markets and insurance partners and the Product Issuer)
Regulatory Compliance – The Company’s regulatory team has engaged Dentons to liaise with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and Colin Biggers & Paisley to liaise with Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to provide a technical and pre-cut briefing and ensure full compliance with financial services laws and consumer protection regulations.
Distribution Channels – Futureproof is securing key distribution partners such as major Australian banks (e.g. Westpac (an Accenture client)), non-bank lenders (e.g. PepperMoney, Resimac) and product design changes made in consultation with a major non-bank lender and their lawyers, now ensures the EPM as having no element of a financial product, not requiring financial advice and able to be widely distributed via mortgage brokers.
Market Education - Recognising that many retirees may be unfamiliar with these type of "mortgage products", the Company will be delivering extensive financial literacy campaigns and partnering with Product Issuers to educate their distribution channels. 
Why Invest in EPM?  

Disruptive Market Opportunity - EPM taps into a growing market for the next 25 years as populations age and retirees need retirement income and aged care funding.
Diversification - The investment in EPM provides exposure to an uncorrelated asset class, balancing traditional equities and bonds in your portfolio.
Founders and Executive Team – Futureproof was founded by Allianz alumni, with insurance, banking, product and regulatory teams led by industry veterans: 
Insurance team- John Innes (former Head of Product for Australia’s largest insurer) and Ian Holt (former Head of Europe for Aviva)
Banking team – James Huey (former Head of Commercial & Retail Banking, Westpac and 15 years Director of Resimac)
Product Team – John De Ravin (former Chief Actuary of MunichRe)
Capital Markets Team – Shivagar Siva (former structured finance lawyer, Mallesons (Sydney), Freshfields (London/Cayman Islands), Norton Rose (Sydney)) and Dr Anthony De Francesco (former Head of Research and Senior Quant, Colonial First State)
Regulatory & Govt Team – Dan Crennon KC (former Deputy Chair of ASIC, Former Director BNK Bank) and Dr Peter Langkamp OAM (former Director, Accenture)
Tech & Platform Team – Dennis Tang (MD, ZeroOne Labs) and Denis Tebbutt (former MD, Intersystems Corp, FNS and CSC Asia-Pacific) 
Last Investment Opportunity – The Company is now rapidly gaining traction on its final sprint-to-market.  This Pre-A round is likely to be the last investment opportunity for HNW investors and Family Offices before Series A (which already has strong interest and likely to be fully committed).
Convertible Note Option - We are also offering a convertible note option with an attractive X% to Y% coupon rate, ensuring fixed returns while maintaining the potential for equity upside.  


To address the hypothetical scenario - below is a structured breakdown of possible returns, assuming the inclusion of equity: 


	1.    Initial Investment: $10M

HNWIs / FOs typically make large investments to benefit from equity stakes in companies.
Offering 20% equity in exchange for a $10M investment could incentivise a long-term commitment while preserving ownership for the founding team.
	2.    Equity Return Potential: 25%-50% IRR

With equity, the investor would be looking for an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of between 25% and 50%, depending on the company’s growth potential and valuation. If the company experiences significant growth, particularly in a high-demand sector like property financing, these returns could even exceed 50%. 
Example:
$10M investment for 20% equity in a company valued at $50M pre-investment.
If the company grows to a $400M valuation in 5 years, the value of their 20% equity stake increases from $10M to $80M.  
3. Equity Growth Scenario: 5-Year Exit

Company Valuation Growth: If the company achieves 8x growth in valuation over 5 years, from $50M to $400M, the equity stake could grow proportionally.
HNW Investor's Return: The investor’s equity grows from $10M to $80M.
Capital Gain: $70M (growth of equity stake from $10M to $80M).
Annualised ROI: 600% total return, equivalent to an IRR of 48% over 5 years.  
4. Blended Return with Yield Component

If we also offer a yield on the invested capital while the company grows (e.g., through preferred dividends or coupon payments on convertible notes), the overall return can be even more attractive:

Annual Yield on Debt Component: 10% yield on $10M investment = $1,000,000 per year ($5M over 5 years).
Equity Growth: As noted, the equity portion grows from $10M to $80M, generating $70M in capital gains.
Total Return (Including Yield + Equity Growth):
Yield: $5M
Capital Gain on Equity: $70M
Total Value after 5 years: $75M.
Total Gross Return: 650% over 5 years, which translates to a 50% IRR. 
5. Potential Scenario (IPO/Acquisition)

IPO or Acquisition Event: If the company goes public or is acquired at a premium multiple, equity could appreciate substantially more. Valuation multiples in the range of 5x to 10x ARR or up to 15x EBITDA for SaaS technology businesses are not uncommon.
Given the such long-term nature of Futureproof’s ARR (50bps loan margin on mortgages 15-30 years), Investors should expect the Company to be at or near the top-end of multiples. 
6. Downside Protection via Convertible Note

Offering a convertible note structure can provide downside protection, giving the investor the ability to either take an interest rate return (e.g., 8%-12% per annum) or convert the note into equity where the Company delivers significant upside growth.
This combination of yield and equity allows for a blended strategy where the investor benefits from consistent income while retaining upside exposure.  
7. Exit Strategy

A well-defined exit strategy is crucial. It can include a future IPO, merger, or strategic acquisition by a larger company, which are standard ways for equity investors to realise significant gains. The Futureproof leadership group believe the most likely acquirer to be a global investment bank or capital markets partner seeking to secure and grow their market share of multi-billion dollar mortgage funding lines, ETF asset management, mortgage originations and long-term cash flows captured by Futureproof 
Futureproof is also a long-term cash generating business that may also suits the ‘buy and hold’ strategies often preferred by patient capital and Family Offices, in particular.
If IPO is the preferred exit strategy, the Futureproof leadership group sees the opportunity post market-launch as demand grows, to commence a strategic book-build of the cap table by bringing on financial institutions who wish to be Product Issuers and Partners by requiring them to take a strategic shareholding as a pre-condition to white-label access of the EPM. 
Summary of Highest Return Potential

Equity Stake: 20%
Growth in Company Valuation: 10x to 15x over 5 years
Potential Total ROI: 250%-500% over 5 years, equating to a 50%-60% IRR annually.
Blended Yield and Equity Return: Offering both equity growth and an annual yield can provide attractive, lower-risk returns while still offering significant upside potential. Total returns could be as high as 300%-500% in certain high-growth scenarios.
