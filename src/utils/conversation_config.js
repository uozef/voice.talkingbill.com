'This opportunity highlights the Equity Preservation Mortgage®️ (EPM), a pioneering product for asset-rich, cash-poor retirees. EPM provides tax-free annuity income without home equity depletion, ideal for the 65% of retirees who own homes but lack liquid funds. Set to launch in Australia in Q2 2025, EPM addresses a major gap left by traditional reverse mortgages.

Key Points:
Market Opportunity: Australia’s retiree market is growing, with over 4.2 million retirees and 75% home ownership. EPM could capture up to 20% of the A$128 billion equity release market by Year 10.
Unique Features: EPM offers tax-free annuity income, preserves home equity, and links to S&P 500 returns with comprehensive risk controls and no age or LVR restrictions.
Financial Projections: For a $10M investment with 20% equity, projections show significant revenue growth, with high yield potential in the first five years.
Why Invest in EPM?
EPM meets growing retiree needs, diversifies traditional portfolios, and is backed by a seasoned leadership team. This Pre-A round is likely the final chance for HNW investors before Series A, with options for both equity growth and a convertible note for fixed returns.
